Sponsor Description: CUSP is an interdisciplinary research centre dedicated to the application of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the service of urban communities across the globe. Using New York City as our laboratory and classroom, we strive to develop novel data- and technology-driven solutions for complex urban problems. CUSP’s research and educational initiatives seek to improve city services; optimize decision-making by local governments; create smart urban infrastructures; address challenging urban issues such as crime, environmental pollution and public health issues; and inspire urban citizens to improve their quality of life.


Project Abstract: One of the keys to New York’s rise to being a world-class city is its extensive subway system. As the 21st Century progresses, the expansion of that system may be the key to keeping it competitive with the other great cities in the world.
New York likely needs a new subway line each decade for the next 100 years just to keep pace. Shanghai is doubling its system. Others are extending theirs. What plans does New York have? This report is an e ort to design a study to result in an optimal strategy for expanding the system.


Capstone Project Description & Overview: Using the above data, the following analysis steps shall be done:

• Subway line usage: Perform a thorough analysis of which lines are most overcrowded and which lines have overcrowding that potentially reduces subway usage. Analyze the origin and destination patterns of those who use those lines.

• Economic development opportunities: Review current housing and commercial zones for areas of potential development. Determine which communities are ripe for additional housing or additional commercial activity.

• Determine the number of vehicles emanating from each community in the outer Boroughs and estimate their destinations. Correlate vehicle usage to mass transit availability, mass transit congestion and mass transit commute times.


Project Relevance: Other than the overall advantage of having an e cient mass transit system, I propose three specific reasons for building new subway lines; subway congestion mitigation, targeted economic development, and car use reduction.

1. Subway Congestion Mitigation

Several subway lines resemble cattle cars in the way people are packed into them. (Actually, the MTA’s guidelines for packing are worse than the standards for cattle cars.) Overcrowding is an indication of demand exceeding capacity. Building new lines to accommodate customer comfort for those who currently use the system and encourage more users is an appropriate strategy
for planning new lines. In fact, that was the primary impetus behind the building, now, of the Second Avenue line. The expanded capacity o loaded just enough demand from the Lexington Line to make the No. 6 train run far more efficiently. There are several candidates for expansion, particularly in Queens.

2. Targeted Economic Development

Twenty-five years ago, when the restart of the Second Ave Subway was proposed, some people assumed I would be ecstatic about the prospects of a new line. I said I was delighted, but what NY needed most was a 10th Avenue Subway. I of course was not alone in that belief, which
was based on the fact that if you stood at Chelsea Piers, you could see most of the Empire State Building halfway across Manhattan. That meant there was nothing but low-rise buildings between the waterfront and 5th Avenue. I said the reason there was little economic activity
in that area was the lack of mass transit, and that a 10th Avenue Subway would open it up for development. As expected, the building of the extension of the No. 7 line down 10th Avenue opened that area and enabled the creation of a new city within the city, something on the order of Cincinnati. There still are areas in the City that would benefit economically from a new line. In this regard, the City should consider new lines that go from outer-borough to outer-borough creating far more accessibility for workers and shoppers.

3. Reducing Car Use

Most people who drive into Manhattan at rush hour actually do it because it is the fastest and most convenient was to go, even though many people would consider it excruciating. NY has vast areas that have now subway service and the bus service is spotty and slow. A new line or extension of a line to some of these areas may just provide the opportunity to leave the car at home. This is the most di cult to contemplate since the economics are if and questionable. But when Moses built the LIE, most people said who’s going to use it? Clearly development follows transportation infrastructure. As opposed to the case above where the subway is designed to inspire commercial and residential development, this approach is to provide an alternative to cars for current development.


Learning Outcomes and Deliverables: At the completion of the analysis, the final report shall propose and justify the sequence of the next series of subways to position NY to remain a major capital of the world.


A. Purpose and summary of the project

   As the New York subway continues to face overcrowding, delays, and poor connectivity across the system, expanding the subway system to enhance connectivity, promote economic growth in new areas, and relieve crowding is necessary to support New Yorkers. Constructing new lines can alleviate overcrowding problems in popular stations, open up access to job opportunities, and stimulate economic vitality in the surrounding neighbourhoods. In response to these problems, we have collected data on subway turnstiles, the US Census, socioeconomic factors, building use, and company location, and proposed 8 hypotheses for the locations of new subway lines to be evaluated. With data analysis and connectivity models, we will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each hypothesis to help decision-makers select the optimal subway plan.

B. How to run the code

  The version for python should be 3.8.3 or higher. This code references external data sources.  Where appropriate, guidance is given as to where to obtain the data.  Places, where local drive locations were used, are highlighted for the user to change.
